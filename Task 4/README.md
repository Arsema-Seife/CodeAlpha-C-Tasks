# 🏦 Simple Bank Account System (C++)

This is a C++ console program that lets users manage multiple bank accounts with basic operations. It supports creating accounts, depositing, withdrawing, transferring money, and saving data to text files. Perfect beginner project! 💸✨

## 🔹 Features
- Create up to **10 accounts**
- Deposit & withdraw money 💰
- Transfer between accounts ✅
- Show all account balances
- Saves account data to `<name>_account.txt`
- Loads balance if file already exists

## 🔹 How It Works
- Each account has an **owner name** and **balance**
- Data is stored using simple file handling (`fstream`)
- Menu repeats until user chooses Exit
- On exit, all accounts are automatically saved 💾

## 🔹 Notes
- Great for learning **classes, objects, file I/O, arrays & menus** in C++ 📚
- Not secure for real banking (plain text storage 😅)
- Ideal mini-project for university students or beginners 🏫✨
