# 🧩 Sudoku Solver (C++)

This is a C++ console program that solves a **9x9 Sudoku puzzle** using backtracking. You enter the puzzle row by row, and the program figures out the solution for you! 🔥🧠

## 🔹 Features
- Solves standard **9×9 Sudoku** using backtracking  
- Input grid row-by-row (0 = empty cell)  
- Validates each row to prevent invalid entries ✅  
- Prints the puzzle before and after solving  
- Menu-based system with continuous run option  

## 🔹 How It Works
- Finds the next empty cell (value = 0)  
- Tries numbers **1–9** and checks if they're safe  
- Uses backtracking until the puzzle is solved  
- If no solution exists → shows a message 🚫  

## 🔹 Notes
- Great for practicing **recursion, logic, and 2D arrays** in C++ 💻  
- Not a generator — only solves puzzles provided by the user  
- Perfect mini-project for university coursework or practice 🏫✨
